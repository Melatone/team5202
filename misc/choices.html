  Government

<p style="margin-left:10px;margin-right:70px;margin-bottom:0px;text-indent: 20px;">

  The choices made by governments come down to whether they want to rely more heavily on the use of facial recognition as a technology for security or to err more on the side of caution to not tread on the toes of the citizenry. Due to Article 12 of the UN Bill of Human Rights, some countries have struggled with the use of mass surveillance technology while some others have taken a different approach. Using China as an example, they have a variety of security and surveillance programs in place to monitor and watch over its citizens. China has the world's largest surveillance networks put in place by project Sharp Eyes started in 2013. This system is made up of multiple local networks of CCTV cameras that connect to make a system of over 200 million CCTV cameras in public spaces. One of the programs mentioned, Skynet, uses these CCTV cameras and gathers information and images of intersections, gathering places and checkpoints, maps these locations, and flags any illegal behavior picked up by using photo recognition. While China has made its choice abundantly clear on the world stage about its use of CCTV and photo recognition, other countries have been hesitant with that choice. Worry has grown however at the thought that western countries like the UK and US have been instituting mass surveillance measures under the veil of trying to combat terrorism. There is also much confusion present in government agencies that deal with this information and who is truly accountable for any breaches of privacy or legal problems that might occur. </p>

  Cistzens/Customers
</h4>
<p style="margin-left:10px;margin-right:70px;margin-bottom:0px;text-indent: 20px;">

  The choice that citizens/customers need to make with this technology is with how much trust they put in private business or the government to responsibly use this information with their best interests at heart. Some of these decisions are already being made as pew research shows us from a study released on September 4th, 2019, that 56% of American adults trust law enforcement with facial recognition software while trusting tech companies 36% and advertisers 18%. This study shows that the adult population, at least in the US, is more trusting when facial technology is used to combat crime (Public good) instead of being used for convenience or as a service like what tech or advertising companies would do. However, with surveillance on the rise in western nations, especially during covid, citizens and customers will need to make the same choices in the private sector will. Will their freedom for convenience and safety?

  Private Sector

  <p style="margin-left:10px;margin-right:70px;margin-bottom:0px;text-indent: 20px;">
  
    As government regulation of facial recognition software looms over the American private sector, many choices need to be made with the direction commercial use of facial recognition software will be going. Clearview AI is a small company that works with government agencies like the FBI to collate a series of images from Facebook, Google and Venmo to create a facial recognition database that law enforcement use to solve crimes. However, the power of this contracted yet private company goes much further as their database can be used to find people with no government-issued ID or those who have never been arrested and add them to another individual database. People have raised privacy concerns with Clearview who have scraped images and videos off the internet but were later deleted by users. An ACLU class-action lawsuit in Illinois stated "by building a mass database of billions of faceprints without knowledge or consent, Clearview has created the nightmare scenario that we've long feared and has crossed the ethical bounds that many companies have refused to even attempt. Neither the United States government nor any American company is known to have ever compiled such a massive trove of biometrics." However, this is just a small tech-based firm, as opposed to the larger tech companies. Apple contests, despite lawsuits, that "the biometric data remains in the solid-state memory on the Apple Device, which is owned and controlled by the user." However, some have speculated that this information could be passed over to law enforcement which would prove this statement false. The choice companies need to make is in the security and usage of our biometric information, and whether the convenience and security of the technology are worth the risk to privacy.
