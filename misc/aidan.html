<h2>
  Aidan's Ethical Reflection
</h2><hr>
<table>
  <td>
  <p>
  
    Computer Vision while being a very useful and convenient technology for many companies and governments, there are a lot of ethical issues to address. Personally, I hold privacy in a very high regard and see any attempt to undermine it as an attempt to strip a fundamental human right from a person, regardless of past acts and regardless of who the person is. When the government uses this technology, I see it as using facial and photo recognition to profile people and do the job that police and other government agencies should be on the ground doing themselves to be sure they are getting the entire story and information that this technology may not be able to detect. For use in private business, I see this as a technology that they can't help but abuse. As we begin to rely on this kind of system for security, the price of this biometric information will go up, and I do not trust big companies like google and apple to have their customers best interests at heart. I have never used and will never use photo recognition technology for personal use, nor would I ever work on any software that makes use of this technology as I see it as an affront to one of my most important ethical principles.
