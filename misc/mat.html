<h2>
  Mat's Ethical Reflection
</h2>
<hr>
<table>
  <td>
  <p>
  
    In today's society it is important to discuss the ethics behind the rapidly developing technologies such as computer vision. There are many great things that it can achieve such as the automation of jobs within agriculture. It is such a powerful tool and with great power comes great responsibility which is why we must always discuss the ethics behind the evolving technology. I personally believe that privacy is a privilege that every human should have to a certain extent, now with that being said it is hard to acknowledge how much privacy certain people should have even though every person should be equal. I am aware that this technology was created to do good things such as stopping terrorists from doing harm and I believe that it works well to counteract that. For this reason I am not against the idea of this technology. However there is a thin line between spying on certain people and spying on innocent people. It is important that we set stern rules for the people that have access to this technology so that they do not use it for their own agendas. I believe that when the use of this technology is not for the greater good and is instead used for a companies interest such as selling their product it becomes unethical. The technology when used for such things is a breach of privacy  in my opinion and should be an offense that should have strict consequences. We as a society must come together in order to stop these things from happening and put pressure on the government to apply serious rules and consequences against those in place with this technology.  </p>
