<h2>
  Brandyn's Ethical Reflection
</h2><hr>
<table>
  <td>
  <p>
  
I believe when discussing the ethics of Computer Vision, the vast amount of good that it does outside of the realms 
of breaching privacy cannot be discarded. Computer vision's capabilities to completely autonomize industires 
such as agricultre with fruit and vegetable picking robots to trucking wirh self driving vehicles are an immense
 opportunity that very strongly vouch for its increased integration into society. Considering the ethical dilemmas
  caused by computer visions breaches on privacy and so on, I believe that privacy is a privelege that comes at the cost of national or borader scale safety. If it takes the government having your and everyone of your loved one's biometric data to prevent terrorism and/or 
  identify and bring criminals to justice, so be it. As for privately owned companies having said data and using it against you commercially for their own profit is where I draw the line. Knowing more about how such systems as Face ID work with feature matching AI, I feel a lot more at ease with allowing Apple to have the data that I have given it. Knowing it is stored as an image feture fingerprint which is essentially unreadable by any human rather than a photo of every time I've used Face ID has let me put more trust into Apple over the data I'm giving them. Overall, I am a large advocate for the mass use of Computer Vision to better our lives in every way as long as the privacy we sacrifice for our safety isnt being used nefariously or to suit an individual or company.
